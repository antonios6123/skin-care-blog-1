I said it before and I'll say it again, the documents page on Jekyll is my best friend. Although I am very confused and I'm on the verge of switching if it wasn't for the documents page I'd be completely lost. The documents page makes using Jekyll bearable. Using youtube tutorials is also very helpful but Jekyll is very confusing to use. I fully synthesized my work and I have my template ready but other than that I'm fully caught up and on track. Skills that I have learned from this was how to apply this class to the work field in the real world. If a company wanted me to make a website I could send them templates and then they would just give me the raw.txt and I could make any website they want. What I am learning in class is how to manage my time and make sure I do everything on a schedule and I don't fall behind that.
