# Entry 1

 I decided to do skin care as my freedom friday topic because it's been something relevant in my highschool life and I want to learn about it and I'm sure a lot of other people need help with it. My main target is going to be how to identify acne and how to treat it properly. I am currently using multiple sources from medical pages and prior knowledge from visits to the dermatologist. Currently I am at the gathering notes stage, I'm just basically getting all the information that I need to be educated on this topic. I am learning more about the human body, how to make it satisfied and how to properly take care of it. In order to keep my work and presentation neat what I like to do is proof read all of my work to make sure I don't make simple mistakes and that my work can be organized as professional as possible.
