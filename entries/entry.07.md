I'm trying to use the documents page on the Jekyll website but honestly I am very lost and confused, I have no idea where to start and I honestly have no idea how to use Jekyll. I want to ask a question in the Jekyll channel on slack but I really just don't know what to say. I am behind on my timeline because I didn't think that trying to understand Jekyll would give me such a problem. If I don't understand it by the end of this week I am 100% changing to a different website and I will work twice as hard to catch up. Since I've been behind I haven't really learned anything except for the fact that I need to have an active partner next to me when I do new things like this. I am developing responsibility skills and time management skills due to the fact that I need to properly plan out this whole project by myself.
